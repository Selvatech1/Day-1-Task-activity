1. IP Address (Internet Protocol Address):
•	An IP address is a unique numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication.
•	IP addresses are used for two main purposes: identifying the host or network interface and providing the location of the host in the network.
•	There are two main versions of IP addresses in use today: IPv4 (32-bit) and IPv6 (128-bit). IPv6 was introduced to address the exhaustion of IPv4 addresses.
2. Port:
•	A port is a 16-bit number used to identify a specific process or service on a device in a TCP/IP network.
•	Ports are used to enable multiple services or processes to run on a single device and communicate with the outside world.
•	Commonly used ports include Port 80 for HTTP, Port 443 for HTTPS, Port 25 for SMTP (email), and many others.
3. HTTP Methods (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Methods):
•	HTTP methods are verbs used in the HTTP protocol to indicate the desired action to be performed on a resource identified by a URL (Uniform Resource Locator).
•	The most commonly used HTTP methods include:
•	GET: Retrieve data from the server.
•	POST: Send data to the server for processing.
•	PUT: Update a resource on the server.
•	DELETE: Remove a resource from the server.
•	HEAD: Retrieve headers of a resource without its body.
•	PATCH: Apply partial modifications to a resource.
•	These methods are used by web clients (such as browsers) to interact with web servers.
4. MAC Address (Media Access Control Address):
•	A MAC address is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface card (NIC) or network adapter in a computer or networking device.
•	MAC addresses are used at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model to ensure that data is correctly delivered to the intended recipient within a local network (e.g., Ethernet LAN).
•	MAC addresses are typically expressed as a series of six pairs of hexadecimal digits (e.g., 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E).
•	Unlike IP addresses, which can change when a device moves between networks, a MAC address is usually hard-coded into the network hardware and remains constant.
These concepts are fundamental to networking and web communication. Understanding them is crucial for anyone working with computer networks, web development, or network administration.
